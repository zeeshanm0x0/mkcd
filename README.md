# mkcd
mkcd is a bash script which creates a directory and cd into it. I'm very lazy in term of creating directory cding into that directory so thought to create it :P
I was looking for such script and I wasn't able to find something like this in that time maybe some of you also are looking for something like this.
# Command: mkcd mydir
